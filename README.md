This repository highlights my journey as a Data Analyst, featuring multiple real-world projects involving data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting. Tools used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL (MySQL), and Tableau. Each project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support effective decision-making.
